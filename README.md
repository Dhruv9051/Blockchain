# Blockchain Assignment Day 1

Day 1 Assignment:

### 1. What is your understanding of Blockchain?
Ans: Blockchain is the mixture of distributed database & cryptography technology. It is ledger having transaction records which ensures security, transparency & decentralization. Blockchain is chain of blocks where each block has its own number, transaction record, previous block, signature & mining key.For simple understanding, blockchain is a series of blocks where each block has a self hash, some data, and the previous or parent hash.The blocks are consecutively connected by a link where two ends of the link include the parent hash of previous block and the current hash of respective block. So even a minor change to any data results to change of sequence in every other block in the series.This algorithm makes blockchain powerful.

### 2. What is the core problem blockchain trying to solve?
Ans: There are 3 core problems:
i. Authenticity
ii. Security
iii. Need of third party trust

### 3. What are the few features which blockchain will give u?
Ans: It consists of the following features:
i. Verifiable
ii. Unchanged
iii. Tamper-Proof
iv. Immutable

### 4. What all things does a Block Contain?
Ans: A block contain:-
i. Current Block Hash
ii. Data Record of current block
iii. Previous Block Hash
iv. Signature
v. Mining Key

### 5. How is the verifiability of Blockchain is been attained ?
Ans: Verifiability can be attained by
Block 1
0 + new data = Key1
Block2
Key1 + new data = Key2
and this chain continues.

### 6. What exactly do you know about the security of a block?
Ans: Well, a block or the entire blockchain is protected by a strong cryptographic hash algorithm. Each block has a unique hash pointer. Any modification in the block constituents will result in the change in the hash identifier of the block.  Therefore, it offers an excellent level of security. Thus, one needs not to worry about the safety as well as the security of data that is present in a block.
